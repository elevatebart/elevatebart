# Hello Github Visitor

Welcome to my home page.
My name is Bart and I am ElevateBart on all of the networks.

## Blogging
I used to do blogging on alligator.io which is now DigitalOcean
[Some tips to traverse a parsed AST][1]
[Whatâ€™s new in vue-styleguidist 3][2]

## OSS
- I maintain [vue-styleguidist][3] a zero config library to document your VueJS components library. 
- I am like automating documentation. Partly because I do not like to write it, partly because I hate when there is none or its structure is unreadable.
- What I am most proud of recently are two example of powerful automated documentations
	- [vue-live][4] being used on the home page of [vue-formulate][5] and in the docs of [vue chakra-ui][6]
	- [vue-docgen-cli][7] that powers the wonderful docs of [oruga-ui][8] 

## Tech passions
- SVG is magic, you can do whatever image you want with a fraction of the weight. Plus benefits
- CSS should remain CSS whatever people will tell you. Putting css inside of JS for the sake of convenience makes it hard for browsers to optimize and for designers to understand.
